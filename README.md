HCDD 340 Final Project - PTSD Chatbot

## Installation Instructions
* Expo Version: 4.4.3
* Node Version: 12.22.1
	* This is very important, as the Firebase dependency requires a Node version between 12.22 to < 13.0
	* Consider using nvm to install multiple Node versions on your device, this will allow you to select 12.22.1 within the project to run it.
* Please assure that you have Python 3.0 or above installed on your computer

* If you are using a Windows device, you may need to install Visual Studio 2019
	* Within Visual Studio 2019, you will need to install the "Desktop development with C++" workload. This is required for a dependency related to Firebase and Gifted Chat.

* Once these are all installed, project will be runnable with the `expo start` command
